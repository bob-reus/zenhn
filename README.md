# ZenHN

ZenHN is a minimalistic single page website, listing the highest ranking links of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) and nothing else.

As a developer, I'm naturally curious and like to stay up to date on recent IT developments. I'm also easily distracted by endless scrolling, comment sections and information rabbit holes. To find a balance (and because quiet hacker news disappeared a few times already), I wrote **zenHN**: the HackerNews frontpage, brought back to just a list of links. 

## Features

* **Calm:** ZenHN is deliberately minimalist in design. IMO, the title and domain name are sufficient to decide if an article is worth reading. 
* **Easy on the eyes:** There are no ads, comment sections, images or other distractions. There is also a dark version, because I know my target audience.
* **No frills:** No cookies and no javascript. The full page with assets weighs less than 50kb, and that's before gzip.
